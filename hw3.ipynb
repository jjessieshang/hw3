    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "1. We violate the golden rule. StandardScaler computes the mean and standard deviation from the data when fit_transform is called. If you fit it  on the test data, the scaling will be based on statistics (mean, std) from the test rather than solely the training data.\n",
    "2. If we let test data influence model training, our classifier that may overfit to trends in the training data, but generalize poorly to new data. The model is worse in the sense that it may learn patterns that do not generalize to new data, leading to artificially high validation scores but poor real-world performance. \n",
    "3. Using a Pipeline takes care of applying the fit_transform on the train portion and only transform on the validation portion in each fold, reducing change of data leakage. Pipelines streamline the machine learning workflow by bundling multiple preprocessing steps into a single object, which can be reused across models.\n",
    "4. ColumnTransformer is useful when different preprocessing steps need to be applied to different feature types in a dataset, such as scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables as one hot or ordinal, and imputing missing values. IT is used to build all our transformations together into one object, and that way we’re sure we do the same column transforms to all splits of the data.\n"
